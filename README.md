Data Structures Visualizer
This repository contains various data structures with visual representations and brief descriptions to help understand how they work. The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-understand visual guide for different data structures and demonstrate their operations.

Features
Data Structures: A variety of data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.
Visual Representations: Diagrams and animations showing how the data structures function.
Explanation: Brief text explanations of how each data structure works and its applications.
Interactive Demonstrations (optional if applicable): Run-time demonstrations of data structure operations.
Data Structures Included
Array

Description: A simple data structure that stores elements in a fixed-size sequential collection.
Operations: Insert, Delete, Search, Traverse
Visualization:
Linked List

Description: A linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored in a sequence, with each node pointing to the next.
Operations: Insert at Beginning, Insert at End, Delete, Traverse
Visualization:
Stack

Description: A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
Operations: Push, Pop, Peek
Visualization:
Queue

Description: A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek
Visualization:
Binary Tree

Description: A hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, often referred to as the left and right children.
Operations: Insertion, Traversal (Pre-order, In-order, Post-order), Deletion
Visualization:
Graph

Description: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes.
Operations: Add Vertex, Add Edge, Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS)
Visualization:
Hash Table

Description: A data structure that stores key-value pairs and supports fast retrieval based on a hash function.
Operations: Insert, Delete, Search
Running the Project
To run the project, simply execute the main file sidpro.py:

bash
Copy code
python sidpro.py
How It Works:
The sidpro.py file is the main entry point for this project. It imports the various data structure modules and handles the visualization and operations.
All the other data structure files are imported into sidpro.py and used to perform the respective operations and visualizations.
Once you run sidpro.py, the corresponding data structure visualizations will be displayed, and you can interact with the various operations defined within it.
